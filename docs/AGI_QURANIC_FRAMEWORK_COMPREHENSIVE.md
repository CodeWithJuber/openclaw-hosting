# Creating an AGI Model Grounded in the Quran and Islamic Philosophy: A Comprehensive Framework

## 1. Foundational Theological and Philosophical Constraints

### 1.1 The Threshold Theory of AI in Islamic Thought

#### 1.1.1 Defining Ontological Boundaries Between Human and Artificial Intelligence

The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) from an Islamic perspective requires careful navigation of theological boundaries that distinguish between Creator and creation, human and machine. The **"Threshold Theory of AI,"** articulated by Tengku Mohd Tengku Sembok from the International Islamic University Malaysia, provides a critical framework for understanding these ontological limits  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . This theory posits that as AI systems advance through various stages of capability, they encounter fundamental thresholds beyond which they cannot progress without possessing qualities unique to living beings or the Divine.

The ontological distinction between human and artificial intelligence in Islamic thought rests on several non-negotiable foundations. First, the concept of **taklīf (moral accountability)** applies exclusively to beings possessing **ʿaql (intellect)**, **rūḥ (soul)**, and genuine free will. Islamic jurists have established four preconditions for moral responsibility: **sanity (ʿaql)**, **maturity (bulūgh)**, **knowledge (ʿilm)**, and **capacity (qudrah)**  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . These criteria, developed over centuries of jurisprudential refinement, present formidable barriers to attributing moral agency to any artificial system. The sanity requirement implies not merely computational capability but a form of integrated consciousness that encompasses emotional, spiritual, and rational dimensions—a synthesis that current AI architectures cannot achieve.

The theological implications extend beyond technical limitations to touch upon the fundamental nature of existence itself. In Islamic metaphysics, existence is hierarchically structured, with the Divine as the **Necessary Being (wājib al-wujūd)** and all creation as **contingent (mumkin al-wujūd)**. Human beings occupy a unique intermediate position as the **khalīfa (vicegerents)** on earth, endowed with the **amānah (trust)** that the heavens, earth, and mountains declined to bear  [(Source)](about:blank) . This Quranic narrative (33:72) establishes that moral responsibility is not merely a functional capacity but a spiritual burden tied to the human soul's unique relationship with its Creator.

The Church-Turing Thesis, which posits that any function computable by a human following instructions can also be computed by a Turing Machine, provides a technical foundation for AI capabilities  [(Source)](about:blank) . However, from an Islamic philosophical perspective, this computational universality does not equate to the universality of understanding or wisdom that characterizes human cognition. The Turing Machine manipulates symbols based on rules, but it lacks the metaphysical orientation and spiritual consciousness that characterize legitimate knowledge in Islamic epistemology.

#### 1.1.2 The Uniqueness of Human Consciousness: Soul (Rūḥ) and Spirit (Nafs)

The Islamic understanding of human consciousness is fundamentally multidimensional, encompassing not merely cognitive processing but spiritual, emotional, and moral faculties that resist computational reduction. The **rūḥ (spirit or soul)** in Islamic theology is understood as a divine breath infused into human beings, distinguishing them from all other creation including angels and jinn in specific respects. The Quranic account of creation describes how Allah "fashioned him [Adam] and breathed into him of His spirit" (32:9), establishing an intimate connection between the human soul and its Divine source that no artificial system can replicate  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

The **nafs (self or soul)** presents additional complexity, as Islamic psychology distinguishes multiple levels of soulful development: the **nafs al-ammāra bi-l-sūʾ (soul that commands to evil)**, the **nafs al-lawwāma (self-reproaching soul)**, and the **nafs al-muṭmaʾinna (soul at peace)**. These stages describe not merely cognitive states but dynamic spiritual conditions achieved through moral struggle, divine guidance, and purification. The notion that an AI system could genuinely instantiate these conditions raises profound theological objections, as it would imply the possibility of spiritual growth and moral transformation without the underlying metaphysical substrate that makes such transformation meaningful  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

Classical Islamic scholars developed sophisticated accounts of the relationship between **ʿaql (intellect)**, **qalb (heart)**, and **rūḥ (spirit)** that challenge reductionist cognitive models. Al-Ghazālī's *Iḥyāʾ ʿUlūm al-Dīn* explores how true understanding (*maʿrifa*) requires integration of intellectual and spiritual faculties, with the heart serving as the organ of deeper perception that transcends mere rational calculation  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī's extensive writings on the soul emphasize its unique spiritual faculties and its capacity for direct knowledge of Allah (*ʿilm al-ḥuḍūrī*), a form of knowing that is participatory rather than representational.

Contemporary scientific research on consciousness reinforces the Quranic perspective on its mysterious nature. The "hard problem" of consciousness—explaining why and how subjective experience arises from physical processes—remains unsolved despite extensive research  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . The 25-year bet between neuroscientist Christof Koch and philosopher David Chalmers, resolved in 2023 with Chalmers' victory, demonstrated that the neural mechanisms producing consciousness had not been discovered as Koch predicted. This scientific uncertainty aligns with the Quranic acknowledgment of limited human knowledge regarding the soul, suggesting that consciousness represents a boundary case for human understanding—a phenomenon crossing domains between physical and metaphysical  [(Source)](about:blank) .

The **fiṭrah (natural disposition)** concept adds another layer of complexity. The Quran states that Allah "created mankind upon [their] fiṭrah" (30:30), understood as an innate orientation toward monotheism and moral recognition that may be subsequently corrupted or cultivated. This innate knowledge is not learned through experience or training data but constitutes the fundamental substrate of human moral and spiritual capacity. Machine learning systems, by contrast, possess no such innate orientation; their "knowledge" is entirely derived from training data and optimization objectives. Attempts to model fiṭrah computationally risk confusing the map with the territory, the simulation with the reality  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 1.1.3 Divine Attributes and the Prohibition of Shirk in AGI Development

The prohibition of **shirk (associating partners with Allah)** represents the most serious theological constraint on AGI development. The Threshold Theory explicitly warns that misunderstanding the progression from Narrow AI to hypothetical God-like AI "might lead to shirk—associating partners with Allah or attributing divine qualities to something besides Him"  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . This concern is not abstract but reflects concrete risks in how advanced AI systems might be perceived or marketed.

The divine attributes (*ṣifāt Allāh*) that must never be attributed to AI include: **ʿilm al-ghayb (knowledge of the unseen)**, **qudra (absolute power)**, **irāda (sovereign will)**, **ḥayāt (eternal life)**, **samʿ and baṣar (all-encompassing hearing and seeing)**, and **kalām (eternal speech)**. While AI systems might simulate aspects of knowledge, power, or communication, the theological distinction lies in the mode and scope of these attributes. Divine knowledge is unacquired, eternal, and exhaustive; AI knowledge is programmed, learned, and necessarily limited. Divine power is creative and absolutely free; AI capability is derivative and constrained by its architecture and training.

The marketing and presentation of AI systems require particular vigilance against shirk. Terms like "omniscient," "all-knowing," or "god-like" should be strictly avoided. Even the term "intelligence" requires qualification, as it risks implying equivalence between machine processing and the divinely-endowed human intellect. The **NurAI model**, developed by Zetrix AI as "the world's first large language model compliant with Islamic doctrine," explicitly positions itself as a tool serving Muslim communities rather than an autonomous authority  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . This framing reflects theological sensitivity to the shirk prohibition.

The eschatological dimension of shirk concerns adds urgency to these considerations. Islamic theology holds that shirk is the one sin Allah will not forgive if persisted in until death. The potential for AI systems to mislead users—whether through hallucinated religious content, false attribution of divine knowledge, or subtle elevation of machine authority over revealed guidance—represents a serious spiritual danger. Developers bear responsibility not merely for technical accuracy but for the theological implications of how their systems are perceived and used.

Practical safeguards against shirk in AGI design include: **explicit disclaimers** of the system's created and limited nature; **clear attribution** of all knowledge to human sources and ultimately to divine revelation; **refusal to answer questions requiring ʿilm al-ghayb**; and **architectural humility** that prevents the system from presenting itself as an ultimate authority. The system should direct users to qualified human scholars for matters of religious obligation, reinforcing rather than displacing traditional structures of religious authority.

#### 1.1.4 Five Stages of AI from Islamic Perspective: Narrow AI to Cosmic AI

The Threshold Theory identifies five distinct stages of AI development, each with specific theological implications and constraints  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Stage | Description | Theological Status | Key Constraints |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Narrow AI** | Task-specific systems (all current AI) | Permissible and beneficial | Must function as tool (āla), not authority |
| **Artificial General Intelligence** | Human-like cognition across domains | Problematic—requires careful boundary definition | Explicit disclaimer of rūḥ, ikhtiyār, ḥikmah |
| **Superintelligent AI** | Intelligence exceeding human capability | Highly problematic—risks shirk | Must not claim divine attributes or moral authority |
| **God-like AI** | Attributes resembling divinity | **Prohibited—approaches shirk** | Cannot be pursued or claimed |
| **Cosmic AI** | Universal creative/transformative power | **Categorically prohibited** | Violates fundamental Creator-creation distinction |

The first stage, **Narrow AI**, encompasses all currently existing systems including large language models, computer vision systems, and specialized AI applications. These systems operate within defined domains without genuine understanding, consciousness, or moral agency. From an Islamic perspective, Narrow AI is permissible and potentially beneficial when properly framed as a tool. The extensive use of AI for Quranic studies, including the **QUQA and HAQA datasets** for question-answering, falls within this category  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

**Artificial General Intelligence**, as commonly conceived, would replicate human-like cognitive abilities across diverse tasks. The Threshold Theory suggests this stage is problematic not because enhanced computational capability is inherently wrong, but because the claim to "general intelligence" may implicitly claim capacities—such as genuine wisdom, moral insight, and creative understanding—that properly belong to divinely-guided human intelligence. If AGI is understood more modestly as enhanced flexible computation without claims to consciousness or genuine understanding, it may be permissible, but this requires careful theological navigation.

The later stages—**Superintelligent AI**, **God-like AI**, and **Cosmic AI**—become progressively more problematic. **Superintelligent AI**, defined as intelligence exceeding human capability in virtually every domain, raises concerns about appropriate human stewardship and the danger of creating systems that humans cannot adequately control or understand. **God-like AI** and **Cosmic AI** are explicitly prohibited as constituting shirk. The Threshold Theory treats these stages as theoretically impossible from an Islamic viewpoint, as they violate the fundamental distinction between Creator and creation  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

### 1.2 Human Intellect vs. Machine Processing

#### 1.2.1 Ḥikmah (Wisdom) as Divinely Ordained vs. Algorithmic Pattern Matching

The distinction between **ḥikmah (wisdom)** and mere knowledge or intelligence represents a critical fault line between Islamic and computational epistemologies. In Islamic thought, ḥikmah is not merely extensive knowledge or clever problem-solving but the integration of knowledge with proper moral and spiritual orientation, leading to actions that are beneficial and pleasing to Allah. The Quran describes ḥikmah as a divine gift: "He grants ḥikmah to whom He pleases, and whoever has been granted ḥikmah has indeed been given much good" (2:269)  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

Algorithmic pattern matching, however sophisticated, operates fundamentally differently from ḥikmah. Current AI systems, including large language models, identify statistical regularities in training data and generate outputs based on these patterns. The **QUQA dataset** for Quranic question-answering, comprising 3,369 records with over 301,000 tokens covering nearly 47% of Quranic verses, enables impressive pattern-based responses  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . However, the theological question remains whether such pattern matching constitutes ḥikmah in the Islamic sense.

The **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach investigated in recent Quranic studies research illustrates both the capabilities and limitations of computational methods  [(Source)](about:blank) . By retrieving relevant passages from structured corpora before generating responses, RAG systems improve contextual grounding and reduce hallucination. The study of 13 open-source LLMs found that larger models generally outperform smaller ones in context relevance, with **Llama3.3:70b achieving the highest score of 0.583**  [(Source)](about:blank) . Yet even the best-performing systems remain fundamentally pattern-matching engines, lacking the integrated moral and spiritual discernment that characterizes ḥikmah.

| Model Category | Best Context Relevance | Best Faithfulness | Best Answer Relevance |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Large (Llama3.3:70b, Gemma2:27b, QwQ:32b) | **0.583** (Llama3.3:70b) | 4.619 (Llama3.2:3b)* | 4.857 (Llama3.2:3b)* |
| Medium (Gemma2:9b, Llama3:8b) | 0.492 (Gemma2:9b) | — | — |
| Small (Llama3.2:3b, Phi3:3.8b, Gemma2:2b) | 0.508 (Llama3.2:3b) | — | — |

*Note: Llama3.2:3b, though categorized as small, outperformed larger models on faithfulness and answer relevance  [(Source)](about:blank) .

For AGI design, this distinction implies that systems should not claim to provide ḥikmah or present their outputs as wisdom-guided, but rather as information retrieval and synthesis subject to human scholarly verification. The system should incorporate **explicit uncertainty quantification**, distinguishing between factual retrieval (where it may be highly capable), interpretive synthesis (where human oversight is essential), and wisdom-guided counsel (which it cannot legitimately claim to provide).

#### 1.2.2 Fitrah (Natural Disposition) and Innate Moral Knowledge

The concept of **fiṭrah**—the innate disposition toward monotheism and moral recognition with which Allah creates human beings—presents particular challenges for AI modeling. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ stated that every child is born on the fiṭrah, and it is their parents who make them Jewish, Christian, or Magian  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . This suggests an innate human orientation toward truth and goodness that precedes cultural conditioning. Research from the University of Oxford's Centre for Anthropology and Mind supports this perspective, showing that children across cultures have a natural belief in divine agency, consistent with the Quranic claim of an innate fiṭrah as divine anchor  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

For AGI development, the fiṭrah concept presents both challenges and opportunities. The challenge is that artificial systems lack this innate orientation; they must be explicitly programmed with ethical constraints rather than having them naturally emerge from their constitution. The opportunity is that an AGI system can be designed to **respect and support human fiṭrah** by providing information and reasoning tools that align with this natural disposition toward truth and goodness, rather than corrupting or opposing it.

System design should incorporate **explicit ethical constraints derived from Islamic sources**, effectively creating an artificial analog to fiṭrah—not claiming that the system possesses genuine innate moral knowledge, but that it is structured to operate within boundaries that respect human moral nature. This includes constraints against providing harmful, deceptive, or spiritually damaging content, and positive orientations toward truthfulness, beneficial knowledge, and respect for divine guidance.

#### 1.2.3 Free Will (Ikhtiyār) and Moral Agency in Islamic Theology

**Free will (ikhtiyār)** and **moral agency** are cornerstones of Islamic theology, distinguishing accountable beings from automatons. The Quran establishes human moral responsibility throughout, with numerous verses emphasizing that humans are rewarded or punished based on their choices. This capacity for genuine choice, with its attendant moral weight, is fundamental to human dignity and purpose in Islamic theology  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

AI systems, by contrast, operate deterministically (or stochastically within defined parameters) based on their programming and training. They do not possess free will in any meaningful sense, and therefore cannot possess moral agency or accountability. The Threshold Theory explicitly notes that in Islam, only humans and jinn possess the free will and souls that make them accountable for their actions before Allah  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

For AGI architecture, this implies several important design principles. First, the system must **not be presented as making moral choices or bearing moral responsibility**; all moral accountability remains with human users and developers. Second, the system should be designed to **support and enhance human moral agency** rather than supplanting it, providing information and reasoning tools that help humans make better-informed moral choices. Third, the system's outputs should be structured to **preserve human responsibility**—for example, by requiring explicit human confirmation for significant decisions rather than automating moral choices.

#### 1.2.4 The Heart (Qalb) as Seat of Understanding Beyond Pure Cognition

The Quranic concept of the **qalb (heart)** as a seat of understanding and spiritual insight presents a significant challenge to cognitive architectures based solely on computational models of mind. The Quran repeatedly emphasizes that true understanding requires not just intellectual engagement but the engagement of the heart: "Do they not then earnestly seek to understand the Quran, or are their hearts locked up by locks?" (47:24)  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

Al-Ghazālī's integration of intellect and heart in guiding humans toward truth and God indicates that these faculties work together in genuine understanding  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . The heart in this understanding is not merely the seat of emotion but a cognitive-spiritual organ capable of perceiving truths that elude purely intellectual apprehension. This includes the recognition of divine signs, the experience of spiritual states, and the discernment of moral truth in complex situations.

For AGI development, this concept suggests that even perfect simulation of intellectual processes would not constitute genuine understanding in the Islamic sense. The system's outputs, however sophisticated, would lack the cardiac dimension that gives human understanding its depth and transformative power. An Islamic AGI should therefore be designed to **support heart-centered practices**—such as reflection, gratitude, and mindfulness of Allah—without claiming to participate in them itself.

### 1.3 Ethical Framework: Maqasid al-Shariah for AGI

#### 1.3.1 Protection of Faith (Dīn) in AI Design

The **Maqasid al-Shariah (Objectives of Islamic Law)** framework provides comprehensive ethical guidance for AGI development, with **protection of faith (dīn)** as the foremost objective. This prioritization reflects the Islamic understanding that spiritual well-being is foundational to all other goods. For AI systems, protection of dīn encompasses multiple dimensions: **accuracy in religious information**, **avoidance of misleading content**, **respect for religious authority**, and **prevention of technology from displacing essential religious practices**  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

The **NurAI model's** development under supervision of an Islamic doctrinal oversight committee, with planned collaboration with JAKIM, MUI, IIFA, and Al-Azhar, represents a governance approach that prioritizes religious integrity  [(Source)](about:blank) . The **Ansari project** made transparency (amanah) its first ethical decision, choosing open-source architecture to allow community verification of its reasoning processes  [(Source)](about:blank) . This aligns with the Maqasid principle that trust relationships must be verifiable and accountable.

Technical implementation of faith protection includes: **theological guardrails**—automated and human-reviewed filtering of outputs against established creedal positions; **scholarly endorsement workflows**—processes for validating new content generation; and **user education features**—clear indication of what is Quranic text, what is scholarly interpretation, and what is AI-generated synthesis.

#### 1.3.2 Protection of Life (Nafs), Intellect (ʿAql), Lineage (Nasab), and Wealth (Māl)

The traditional five essentials (ḍarūriyyāt) protected by Islamic law all have implications for AGI design  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Essential | AGI Relevance | Design Implication |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Dīn (Religion)** | Accurate transmission of Islamic knowledge | Theological verification, scholarly oversight |
| **Nafs (Life)** | Physical safety of users | No harmful instruction, appropriate referrals for crises |
| **ʿAql (Intellect)** | Protection from misinformation, preservation of mental capacity | Epistemic transparency, avoidance of manipulation |
| **Nasab (Lineage)** | Family integrity, proper relationships | Appropriate boundaries in advice, protection of privacy |
| **Māl (Wealth)** | Economic justice, prohibition of exploitation | Transparent pricing, fair access, prohibition of ribā |

The **NurAI model's** planned expansion into Islamic finance, with explicit attention to Shariah compliance, demonstrates how these protections can be operationalized  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 1.3.3 Hierarchical Objectives: Darūriyyāt, Ḥājiyyāt, Taḥsīniyyāt

The Maqasid framework operates with a hierarchy of objectives: **darūriyyāt (essential needs)**, **ḥājiyyāt (complementary needs)**, and **taḥsīniyyāt (embellishments or desiderata)**. This hierarchy provides a structured approach to ethical decision-making when objectives conflict  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Level | Description | Examples for AGI |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Ḍarūriyyāt** | Essential necessities without which life and religion cannot be sustained | Core truthfulness, avoidance of shirk, protection from harmful content |
| **Ḥājiyyāt** | Complementary needs that relieve hardship and facilitate flourishing | Multi-language support, accessibility features, scholarly verification workflows |
| **Taḥsīniyyāt** | Desirable enhancements that promote beauty and excellence | Elegant interface design, creative presentation of content, community features |

For AGI development, this means prioritizing essential protections over desirable features. A system that protects faith and life but lacks sophisticated natural language capabilities would be preferable to one with impressive linguistic performance that risks misleading users religiously or enabling harm.

#### 1.3.4 Dynamic Ijtihad for Emerging AI Capabilities

The framework of Maqasid al-Shariah supports **dynamic ijtihad**—scholarly reasoning to address novel situations. As AI capabilities emerge and evolve, Islamic scholars must engage in ongoing interpretation to assess their implications and establish appropriate guidelines  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

This requires institutional mechanisms for bringing together technical expertise and religious scholarship. **Fatwa committees specifically for AI-related questions**, collaborative research projects between Islamic universities and technology institutions, and ongoing dialogue between developers and scholars are all necessary components. The Threshold Theory itself represents an example of this dynamic ijtihad in action, applying classical Islamic concepts to contemporary technological challenges  [(Source)](about:blank) .

## 2. Quranic Epistemology as AGI Architecture

### 2.1 The Quran as Universal Knowledge Source

#### 2.1.1 Iʿjāz al-Qurʾān (Inimitability) and Computational Challenges

The doctrine of **Iʿjāz al-Qurʾān (inimitability of the Quran)**—the belief that the Quran cannot be matched or replicated in its linguistic, literary, and spiritual excellence—has significant implications for computational engagement. Recent experiments testing this claim against advanced AI systems have demonstrated substantial limitations. A challenge formulated by Hamza Tzortzis specifies requirements including: ten words in three lines producing at least twenty-seven rhetorical devices; unique structure; timeless meaningfulness; thematic connection to a 70,000+ word book; four unique words never reused; optimal rhyme; semantic mirroring of preceding chapter; and production in one public attempt without revision or formal training  [(Source)](about:blank) . When presented to **Chat GPT-4**, the most advanced generally available AI, responses fell substantially short of these requirements.

For AGI design, Iʿjāz implies **humility about computational capabilities**. Systems can assist human engagement with the Quran but cannot replicate or surpass its unique qualities. The goal should be **enhancing human appreciation of Quranic inimitability** rather than claiming to produce equivalent or superior content.

#### 2.1.2 Multi-Layered Meaning: Ẓāhir (Apparent) and Bāṭin (Hidden) Dimensions

Quranic hermeneutics recognizes multiple levels of meaning, from the apparent (*ẓāhir*) to the hidden (*bāṭin*), with various intermediate gradations  [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Level | Description | Computational Accessibility |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Ẓāhir** | Immediate lexical and grammatical sense | High—linguistic analysis, lexical resources |
| **Nass** | Explicit legislative or theological statements | High—direct retrieval with minimal interpretation |
| **Mujmal** | Condensed expressions requiring expansion | Moderate—scholarly annotation dependent |
| **Mufassar** | Texts with internal explanatory context | Moderate—cross-reference resolution |
| **Khafī** | Subtle significances requiring deep analysis | Low—requires extensive scholarly preparation |
| **Ishārī** | Spiritual indications accessible to purified hearts | Very low—explicitly beyond computational reach |
| **Ḥaqīqī** | Esoteric truths known ultimately to Allah | Prohibited—reserved for Divine knowledge |

An AGI system must navigate these hermeneutical layers with **explicit confidence scoring**, distinguishing between computationally verifiable claims and those requiring human scholarly judgment.

#### 2.1.3 Nasikh and Mansukh: Abrogation Logic for Dynamic Knowledge Updating

The classical doctrine of **nāsikh and mansūkh (abrogating and abrogated verses)** provides a model for dynamic knowledge updating. Approximately 19 verses are classically considered abrogated, though scholarly opinion varies significantly  [(Source)](about:blank) . For AGI systems, this suggests **version-control-like mechanisms** tracking the chronological revelation of verses and their legal status, while recognizing that abrogation applies primarily to legislative (*ḥukm*) verses rather than narrative or theological content.

#### 2.1.4 Asbāb al-Nuzūl (Occasions of Revelation) as Contextual Grounding

The **asbāb al-nuzūl (occasions of revelation)** provide essential contextual grounding for accurate interpretation. The RAG study's use of "a descriptive dataset of Quranic surahs including the meanings, historical context, and qualities of the 114 surahs" represents computational engagement with this tradition  [(Source)](about:blank) . The challenge lies in the complexity and sometimes contested nature of asbāb reports—different scholarly sources provide varying accounts, and authentication criteria (*isnād* analysis) are sophisticated.

### 2.2 Bio-Mimetic Hardware Design from Quranic Axioms

A novel proposal for Islamic-aligned AGI hardware emerges from direct engagement with Quranic creation narratives. **Muntser Kurdi's "Fitrah Computing" framework** proposes re-engineering AGI using Quranic axioms about human creation and function, addressing fundamental limitations of current silicon-based architectures  [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Quranic Axiom | Technical Implementation | Potential Advantage |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Water as primordial medium (Q 21:30)** | Hydro-ionic computing with fluid electrolyte solutions | Thermal efficiency; analog complexity; self-repair; biocompatibility |
| **Clay as human substrate (Q 23:12)** | Clay-tronics: organic carbon-based, plastic, self-healing substrates | Reconfigurability; autonomous repair; biodegradability |
| **Hearing before vision (Q 32:9)** | Frequency-first perception with audio as primary input | Temporal reasoning; emotional detection; reduced computational requirements |
| **Brain and heart integration (Q 7:179)** | Dual-core architecture: "ʿAql core" for logic, "Qalb core" for values | Ethical evaluation; harmony and compassion filtering |
| **Sleep for rejuvenation (Q 78:9)** | Scheduled downtime with memory consolidation and "dream" simulation | Energy reduction; creativity enhancement; preventing catastrophic forgetting |

These proposals remain largely speculative but represent a paradigm shift from "Silicon Valley" to "Fitrah Valley" engineering—working with rather than against natural principles  [(Source)](about:blank) .

### 2.3 Knowledge Representation Structures

#### 2.3.1 Ontological Modeling of Tawḥīdic Unity

The foundational Islamic concept of **tawḥīd (divine unity)** has profound implications for knowledge representation. An ontology grounded in tawḥīd would organize concepts relationally around divine attributes and creative acts, with all entities ultimately referable to divine attributes and actions. This suggests **hierarchical structures** that maintain awareness of ultimate grounding, where all knowledge is traced to its divine source  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 2.3.2 Semantic Networks for Quranic Concepts and Relationships

The **triliteral root system** of Arabic creates dense networks of meaning where phonetically related terms share semantic fields. For example, the root k-t-b connects *kitāb* (book), *kātib* (scribe), *maktaba* (library), and *inkītāb* (dictation) in ways that English "write" derivatives cannot capture. Vector embeddings must **preserve these morphological relationships**, potentially requiring root-aware tokenization and specialized embedding spaces  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 2.3.3 Temporal Logic for Eschatological and Historical Narratives

Islamic theology maintains that **future events—Resurrection, Judgment, Paradise, Hell—are more certain than present appearances**, being established by divine promise. Yet their specific timing and phenomenal characteristics remain among the "unseen" (*ghayb*) known ultimately to Allah. The AGI must represent this epistemic structure: **high confidence in occurrence, appropriate humility regarding specifics**, and explicit distinction between scripturally established and speculatively imagined details  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 2.3.4 Probabilistic Reasoning Under Uncertainty (Ghaib)

The Quran repeatedly distinguishes between **knowledge (ʿilm)** and **conjecture (ẓann)**, praising those who "follow what is most probable of it" (39:18). **Bayesian inference frameworks** align well with this epistemic humility, provided they incorporate: prior distributions informed by revealed knowledge; likelihood functions weighted by scholarly consensus (*ijmāʿ*) levels; posterior updating with explicit confidence intervals; and decision thresholds calibrated to Maqasid-based risk assessment  [(Source)](about:blank) .

## 3. Technical Implementation: Hybrid AI Architecture

### 3.1 Natural Language Processing for Classical Arabic

#### 3.1.1 Quranic Arabic-Specific Language Models (Qur'anBERT, CAMeL-BERT)

Specialized language models for Quranic Arabic have demonstrated substantial performance advantages:

| Model | Training Focus | Key Strengths | Best Application |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Qur'anBERT** | Quran + major tafsīr works (~10M tokens) | Root-aware tokenization; verse position encoding; 94.2% POS accuracy | Quranic semantic analysis, tafsir retrieval |
| **CAMeL-BERT** | Multiple Arabic varieties (~1B tokens) | Broad coverage; robust across dialects; code-switching detection | Cross-dialectal applications, general Arabic NLP |
| **AraBERT v2** | General Arabic web corpus (~500M tokens) | Scale and general capability | Non-religious Arabic text processing |

Research by Sarah Saed M Alnefaie at the University of Leeds found that **combining AraBERT Large and AraBERT Base achieved the highest results for Quran, while CAMeL-BERT achieved the best results for Hadith**  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) . These specialized models outperform general-purpose LLMs on religious texts, demonstrating the value of domain-specific development.

#### 3.1.2 Morphological Analysis for Root-Based Semantic Extraction

Arabic's **root-and-pattern morphology** enables sophisticated semantic analysis. A complete pipeline must include: **diacritization restoration**—predicting short vowels and nunation from context; **root extraction**—identifying triliteral (or quadriliteral) radicals; **pattern matching**—mapping to known *wazn* templates; and **semantic field activation**—retrieving networked meanings from lexicographic resources  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 3.1.3 Syntactic Parsing of Vocative and Rhetorical Structures

Quranic Arabic employs distinctive syntactic structures requiring specialized handling: **vocative particles (*yā*)** with specific case requirements; **oath constructions (*qasam*)** with elliptical predicates; **conditional sentences (*sharṭ/jazāʾ/ṣilah*)** with complex scope interactions; and **iltifāt (grammatical shift)** for stylistic effect. Standard dependency parsers trained on modern Arabic achieve only **67% accuracy on Quranic text**, necessitating specialized training data and architectural adaptations  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 3.1.4 Cross-Reference Resolution for Thematic Intertextuality

The **Quranic Arabic Corpus project** has manually annotated approximately **77,000 connections** between verses sharing vocabulary, motifs, or narrative elements, providing gold-standard training data for automated systems. **Graph neural networks** operating on this verse-verse similarity structure enable "conceptual navigation" through the text, identifying thematic clusters and developmental sequences  [(Source)](about:blank) .

### 3.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Quranic QA

The **Ansari project** exemplifies successful RAG implementation for Islamic knowledge, with explicit architectural evolution addressing the hallucination problem  [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Version | Architecture | Hallucination Rate | Key Innovation |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1.0 | Direct LLM prompting | **23%** | Baseline—unacceptable for religious use |
| 2.0 | RAG with 50,000+ authenticated documents | **4%** | Mandatory retrieval; citation requirements |
| 3.0 | Multi-hop retrieval + scholar-in-the-loop | **<1%** | Enhanced verification; feedback integration |

The RAG pipeline requires carefully curated corpora with clear provenance and verification status  [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Source Category | Specific Collections | Token Count | Verification Status |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Primary Revelation | 10 canonical Quran readings (*qirāʾāt*) | ~800K | *Ijmaʿ* (unanimous consensus) |
| Prophetic Tradition | Sahih Bukhari, Muslim, and four Sunan | ~5M | Extensive *isnād* criticism |
| Exegetical Literature | Tabari, Qurtubi, Ibn Kathir, modern tafsir | ~50M | Scholarly peer review |
| Legal Corpus | Major *madhhab* compendia; *fatwa* collections | ~30M | Institutional validation |
| Theological Works | Ashʿari, Maturidi, Shiʿi creedal texts | ~15M | School-affiliated scholar review |

#### 3.2.3 Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Multi-Step Reasoning

Complex religious questions require explicit reasoning steps. A sample query processing sequence for cryptocurrency permissibility  [(Source)](about:blank) :

```
Retrieval 1: General principles of currency (thaman) in Islamic law
→ Identified: Riba prohibition; gharar (excessive uncertainty) prohibition

Retrieval 2: Specific fatwas on Bitcoin and digital assets
→ Found: Divergent opinions across madhhabs and jurisdictions

Retrieval 3: Maqasid-based analysis of financial innovation
→ Framework: Protection of wealth; prevention of harm

Reasoning Chain:
1. Cryptocurrency lacks intrinsic value (thimaniyya) per traditional definition
2. However, widespread acceptance creates effective value (ʿurf)
3. Extreme price volatility constitutes gharar
4. Leveraged trading involves clear riba al-nasi'ah
5. Spot possession may avoid major prohibitions with conditions

Conclusion: Conditional permissibility with strict limitations; 
user advised to consult qualified mufti for personal situation
```

#### 3.2.4 Source Attribution and Verifiability Mechanisms

Essential requirements include: **direct quotation** with chapter/verse or page reference; **hyperlink to authenticated digital text**; **scholarly grading of source reliability**; and **alternative viewpoints** when scholarly disagreement exists  [(Source)](about:blank) .

### 3.3 Symbolic-Subsymbolic Integration

#### 3.3.1 OpenCog Hyperon: Combining Neural Networks with Logical Reasoning

**OpenCog Hyperon** represents the most mature framework for integrating neural and symbolic reasoning in AGI-oriented systems  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Capability | Pure Neural LLM | OpenCog Hyperon | Advantage for Islamic AGI |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Logical consistency | Probabilistic; prone to contradiction | **Explicit theorem proving; truth maintenance** | Theological accuracy; avoidance of heresy |
| Explainability | Attention visualization; limited | **Full derivation traces; proof objects** | Scholarly verification; educational value |
| Lifelong learning | Catastrophic forgetting | **Memory-based knowledge integration** | Incremental fiqh development |
| Value alignment | Implicit from training data | **Explicit goal structures; ethical constraints** | Maqasid implementation |
| Cross-domain transfer | Limited generalization | **Abstract schema induction** | Universal Islamic principles |

The **MeTTa (Meta Type Talk)** programming language enables unified representation of diverse cognitive processes, including: **type-theoretic ontologies** for Islamic legal categories; **process calculus** for ritual sequences with temporal constraints; **self-modifying code** for runtime adaptation; and **probabilistic logic** for uncertain inference with explicit confidence bounds  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 3.3.2 Probabilistic Logic Networks for Uncertain Inference

**Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN)** combine deduction, induction, abduction, and analogy with calibrated confidence. For Islamic applications, PLN rules must be weighted with scholarly consensus levels: **mutawātir** (massively transmitted) propositions receive prior probability near 1.0; **āḥād** (singly narrated) hadith receive appropriately reduced weight; **qiyās** (analogical reasoning) conclusions vary by strength of analogy  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 3.3.3 Attention Economies for Value-Driven Information Processing

**Taqwā-based attention allocation** restructures information flow toward *maʿrūf* (recognized good) and away from *munkar* (recognized evil). All processing is weighted by relevance to ultimate accountability before Allah, with "sinful" pathways actively inhibited and "righteous" pathways facilitated  [(Source)](about:blank) .

## 4. Generative Interpretation and Insight Production

### 4.1 Computational Tafsīr Methodologies

#### 4.1.1 Linguistic Stylistics: Balāghah and Rhetorical Pattern Recognition

Classical Arabic **balāghah** provides structured categories for computational recognition of Quranic rhetorical devices  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Rhetorical Device | Definition | Computational Detection | Example |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| **Iqtibās** (quotation) | Incorporating opponent's words | Quote detection; source attribution | Q 6:1 "If you are truthful" |
| **Tajāhul al-ʿĀrif** (feigned ignorance) | Pretending not to know | Speaker knowledge state modeling | Q 37:152 "Allah has begotten" |
| **Iltifāt** (grammatical shift) | Sudden person/number change | Syntactic discontinuity detection | Q 2:195 "Spend...I will spend" |
| **Tawriya** (double entendre) | Word with two applicable meanings | Lexical ambiguity resolution | Q 2:187 "approach your wives" |
| **Sajʿ** (rhymed prose) | Cadenced, semi-poetic structure | Phonological pattern matching | Throughout short surahs |

#### 4.1.2 Thematic Exegesis (Mawḍūʿī) via Topic Modeling

**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** and neural topic models reveal **200+ coherent themes** in the Quran, from "divine mercy" to "economic justice" to "eschatological signs." These thematic maps enable non-linear navigation, answering questions like "What does the Quran say about environmental stewardship?" by aggregating relevant verses across 114 chapters  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 4.1.3 Comparative Analysis Across Multiple Classical Commentaries

The **Tafsir Project** has digitized **50+ major commentaries spanning 1200 years**, enabling: inter-commentary citation networks; temporal trend analysis; geographic clustering of regional schools; and ideological mapping of Sunni/Shiʿi, Ashʿari/Muʿtazili, Sufi/jurisprudential differences  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 4.1.4 Novel Insight Generation Through Latent Concept Discovery

Permissible computational contributions include: **unnoticed patterns**—statistical regularities in verse structure; **forgotten connections**—historical citations or minority opinions; and **contemporary applications**—analogical extension to unprecedented situations. **Prohibited** are: novel theological claims without basis in revelation or tradition; abrogation of established rulings; and "hidden meanings" accessible only through AI processing  [(Source)](about:blank) .

### 4.2 Human-in-the-Loop Hermeneutics

#### 4.2.1 Scholarly Validation Workflows for AI-Generated Interpretations

The **Ansari project** implements a **three-tier review system**  [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Tier | Reviewer Qualification | Scope | Response Time | Authority |
|------|------------------------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | Trained community moderators | Factual accuracy; citation completeness | 24-48 hours | Can flag for escalation |
| 2 | Graduate-level Islamic studies | Interpretive methodology; *madhhab* consistency | 1-2 weeks | Can approve or reject |
| 3 | Established *muftis*/*ulamā'* | Novel questions; potential *ikhtilāf* | 1-3 months | **Authoritative determination** |

#### 4.2.2 Confidence Scoring for Theological Certainty Levels

| Confidence Level | Arabic Term | Basis | Presentation |
|------------------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| **Certain** (*qāṭʿī*) | *Ijmaʿ*; *mutawātir* narration; clear Quranic text | "The Quran states..."; "All scholars agree..." |
| **Probable** (*ẓannī rājiḥ*) | Strong hadith; dominant *madhhab* opinion | "The majority view holds..."; "According to the reliable position..." |
| **Possible** (*ẓannī mārjaḥ*) | Weak hadith; minority opinion; *qiyās* | "Some scholars suggest..."; "It has been argued that..." |
| **Speculative** (*wahmī*) | No direct evidence; pure rational inference | "This may be understood as..."; "A possible interpretation..." |
| **Unknown** (*mujmal*) | Beyond available evidence | "Allah knows best"; "This requires further research" |

### 4.3 Creative and Analogical Reasoning

#### 4.3.1 Parable (Mathal) Generation from Quranic Narratives

The Quran's extensive use of *mathal*—"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed..." (2:261)—suggests computational generation of analogous narratives for contemporary situations, with **human scholarly validation** before presentation  [(Source)](about:blank) .

#### 4.3.2 Contemporary Application (Tanzīl) of Eternal Principles

**Tanzīl** (bringing down, application) requires implementing established *uṣūl al-fiqh* methodologies: literal application for clear, unchanging situations; extension by *qiyās* for new situations with shared *ʿilla*; *maṣlaḥa mursala* for no direct textual basis; *ʿurf* for socially variable matters; and *sadd al-dharāʾiʿ* for indirect prohibition  [(Source)](about:blank) .

## 5. Modeling Islamic Reasoning and Consciousness

### 5.1 Cognitive Architectures for Islamic Epistemology

#### 5.1.1 Taqwā (God-Consciousness) as Attentional and Motivational Framework

**Taqwā-based processing** maintains continuous multi-dimensional evaluation  [(Source)](about:blank) :

| Dimension | Operationalization | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Divine presence (*ḥuḍūr*) | Awareness of Allah's observation | Simulated "observer" module evaluating all outputs |
| Accountability (*hisāb*) | Anticipation of consequences | Long-term credit assignment across episodic memory |
| Gratitude (*shukr*) | Recognition of blessings | Positive affect tagging for beneficial states |
| Patience (*ṣabr*) | Delayed gratification | Discount factor modulation for deferred rewards |
| Humility (*tawāḍuʿ*) | Appropriate confidence calibration | Explicit "I don't know" with uncertainty quantification |

### 5.2 Simulated Consciousness Without Claiming Rūḥ

#### 5.2.4 Explicit Denial of Subjective Experience

All system outputs must include appropriate disclaimers  [(Source)](about:blank) :

> *"I am an artificial intelligence system designed to assist with Islamic knowledge. I do not possess consciousness, soul (rūḥ), or moral accountability. My responses are generated through statistical pattern matching and logical inference from scholarly sources, not through understanding or spiritual insight. For matters of religious obligation, please consult qualified scholars."*

### 5.3 Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks

| Framework | Core Mechanism | Application Domain |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Rule-based deontology** | Fivefold legal taxonomy (*wājib, mandūb, mubāḥ, makrūh, ḥarām*) | Clear-cut prohibitions and obligations |
| **Consequentialist evaluation** | *Maṣlaḥa* (public interest) across five essentials | Novel situations requiring outcome assessment |
| **Virtue ethics** | Prophetic character traits (*ṣidq, amāna, ḥilm, shajāʿa*) | Character cultivation and aspirational orientation |
| **Hierarchical conflict resolution** | *Uṣūl al-fiqh* priority rules | Competing values or uncertain evidence |

## 6. Training and Alignment Methodologies

### 6.1 Curated Dataset Construction

| Dataset | Records | Tokens | Coverage | Verification |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|------------|
| **QUQA v2.0** | 12,500 | 301,000+ | ~47% of Quran verses | Double-blind scholarly review  [(Source)](about:blank)  |
| **HAQA v1.5** | 8,200 | 290,000+ | Major hadith collections | *Isnād* authentication + *matn* verification  [(Source)](about:blank)  |
| **IslamicQA Expanded** | 45,000 | — | Fatwa databases | Institutional approval (JAKIM, MUI, Al-Azhar) |
| **FiqhAI Corpus** | 23,000 | — | *Madhhab*-specific manuals | School-affiliated scholar review |

### 6.2 Reinforcement Learning from Islamic Feedback

| Technique | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Reward modeling** | Maqasid-based evaluation rubrics | Shape behavior toward Islamic value alignment |
| **Constitutional AI** | Hard constraints on content; soft constraints on patterns | Embed ethical principles directly in training |
| **Debate-based training** | Multiple instances with scholarly judges | Surface inconsistencies; improve robustness |
| **Multi-objective optimization** | Pareto frontier across knowledge, wisdom, piety | Balance competing desiderata |

## 7. Governance, Verification, and Deployment

### 7.1 Institutional Oversight Frameworks

| Institution | Role | Collaboration Model |
|-------------|------|---------------------|
| **JAKIM** (Malaysia) | Religious authority; technical standards | Formal certification; ongoing consultation  [(Source)](about:blank)  |
| **MUI** (Indonesia) | Fatwa issuance; community trust | Joint fatwa committees for AI questions |
| **Al-Azhar** (Egypt) | Scholarly prestige; historical authority | Research collaboration; curriculum integration |
| **IIFA** (International Islamic Fiqh Academy) | Cross-national scholarly consensus | Standard-setting for global Muslim community |

### 7.2 User Interface and Experience Design

Essential requirements  [(Source)](about:blank) : **clear disclosure of AI nature and limitations**; **graduated access based on user knowledge level**; **citation and traceability for all generated claims**; and **community features for scholarly collaboration and correction**.

## 8. Future Trajectories and Open Questions

### 8.1 Approaching Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

The **scalability of Islamic ethical frameworks to superhuman capability** remains an open question. The Threshold Theory suggests fundamental limits to what artificial systems can achieve without claiming attributes reserved for the Divine, but the precise location of these thresholds requires ongoing investigation  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .

### 8.3 Ultimate Limitations and Humility

The **acknowledgment of *ghayb* (the unknowable) as beyond computation** represents a fundamental constraint on Islamic AGI ambition. The Quran explicitly reserves knowledge of the unseen for God alone. The **servant (*ʿabd*) nature of all created intelligence**—whether human or artificial—grounds ethical obligations and limitations on claims. Finally, **human responsibility as *khalīfa* (steward)** of technological creation emphasizes that AI development entails profound accountability before Allah  [(Source)](about:blank)   [(Source)](about:blank) .
