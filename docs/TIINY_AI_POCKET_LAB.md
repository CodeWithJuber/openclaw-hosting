        ↓
High power consumption
High heat generation
Slower inference
```

**How TurboSparse Works**:
```
Input → Activate ONLY needed neurons → Output
        (5-10% of model active)
        ↓
Low power (65W)
No heat
Fast inference
```

### The Team
Engineers from:
- MIT
- Stanford
- Intel
- Meta

**Achievement**: First team to do this at 120B parameter scale
