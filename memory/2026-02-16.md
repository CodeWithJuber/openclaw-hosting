## OpenClaw Hosting Platform - Development Progress

### Security Fixes Completed (7 Critical Issues)
- JWT RS256 with dual-validation implemented
- HMAC timing attack prevention with timingSafeEqual
- Log sanitization to prevent secret leakage
- Cloud-init input validation to prevent injection
- Rate limiting with Redis token bucket
- AES-256-GCM encryption for API keys
- CORS strict validation with whitelist

### Architecture Implementations
- Agentic RAG system with Aggregator Agent
- 6 specialized agents: WHMCS, API, Dashboard, Infra, QA, Security
- Real-time coordination via Redis Pub/Sub
- Kanban board system for task management
- Agent identity system with avatars and personalities
- Code graph analyzer deferred due to RAM constraints

### Integrations Built
- WhatsApp Business API integration
- Mobile App API endpoints
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/CodeWithJuber/openclaw-hosting
- Docker Compose optimized for 8GB RAM

### Competitors Analyzed
- PicoClaw (Sipeed): 12K stars in 1 week, $10 hardware
- AI Maestro (23blocks): 80+ agents, peer mesh network
- HermitClaw: Personal research companion
- Accomplish AI: Desktop automation
- Kimi Claw: Just launched by Moonshot AI

### Market Intelligence
- ByteByteAI YouTube channel: 22.4K subscribers
- Space Lobster phenomenon: OpenClaw viral growth
- LLaDA 2.1: Diffusion language model breakthrough
- OpenClaw founder reportedly hired by OpenAI

### Resource Constraints
- Limited to 8GB RAM on Linode CPX21
- High-RAM features deferred: code graph, local LLMs, ML models
- Optimized: PostgreSQL 256MB, Redis 128MB, API 1GB

### Deployment Status
- Staging deployment ready
- SSH keys generated for 45.56.105.143
- Production docker-compose created
- Awaiting final deployment to production

### Documentation Created
- 20+ comprehensive docs covering architecture, security, competitors
- Backend development roadmap
- Git commit best practices
- API integration guides

### Key Decisions Made
- RS256 for JWT (asymmetric, recommended)
- AES-256-GCM for encryption
- Self-hosted PostgreSQL on Linode
- Real-time Redis Pub/Sub for coordination
- 3-level rollback system
- Token bucket rate limiting

### Next Steps
- Complete staging deployment
- Run smoke tests
- Verify all 7 security fixes
- Promote to production
- Monitor for issues
